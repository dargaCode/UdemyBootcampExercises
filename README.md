# Udemy Bootcamp Exercises
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS</strong>

I’m 100 lectures into <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">the course I’m taking on Udemy</a>, and I’m really enjoying it. I decided to make sure I actually complete the exercises.

A lot of the first sections are review, but I’m glad I didn’t skip them, since they also contain new information in many cases.

Both cases are great: either I blast right through the lectures and exercises, or I end up learning something I wasn’t aware of before.

The course does have some “real” projects coming up soon, and I’ll continue to fill in the rest of these exercises as I complete them.

This quasi-project is the first time I’ve worked with multiple pages linked together, so I’ve been learning how that workflow is in git, as well as figuring out how to best name things, etc.
